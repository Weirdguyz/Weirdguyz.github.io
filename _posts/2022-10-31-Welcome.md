Hello and welcome to my website. I'm Riley Nitschke, a high school student in Australia, just going through life, learning as much as I can. This website is, I guess, a way for me to document stuff in a way that is easy for myself <i>and</i> for other people to access. This website will not focus on any one specific subject &emdash; I have a love for almost everything in some way &emdash; and will talk about many many different things. Parts may be about world news, others might be poems I wrote, and some might be lessons about mathematical or scientific concepts. Anyways, that's all for now, there is more to come as I get the hang of this. Cheers.
