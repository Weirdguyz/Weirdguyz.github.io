## Introduction
Nutcase is a fantastic tool for websites which allows the author to embed [:explanations](#anexplanation), [:videos](https://youtu.be/bu5-VERN3XY), [:websites](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_Science_and_Mathematics_School), and all sorts of things into the text of the document. These can be expanded or retracted as wanted by the reader, and makes it easier for readrs to read about things that they might need a refresher on.

## Ease of use
Nutcase is incredibly easy to use, and a basic understanding of [:html or markdown](#webstuff) is all that is required! After that, its as simple as adding some [:special, but simple](#codeexample), parts to the text. 

## :x Code example
The code for the link you just clicked is `[:special, but simple](#codeexample)`.

## :x web stuff
Unfortunately, it is possible that this may not be compatible with the way in which the portal is constructed, I'm not sure of the extent to which we will be able to access and edit the pages, and whether we will have low-level html access...

## :x an explanation
This is an explanation of something, and could be anything! Perhaps this is an article about some species of plant, and the explanation is for a specific term or concept that someone may have forgotten.

## Overall...
I really am excited to see how Nutcase can be used to enhance explanations of concepts and ideas, and hope that it will work well with the ideas we have for the Core Learning Skills pages!

## In other news
I'm also looking at integrating [:LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX#) maths equations into html with a tool called [:MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) in a similar way to Nutcase.
